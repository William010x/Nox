Tools/techniques that didn’t worked well:
* We eventually discovered Jira to work well, however it was a little complicated to use for our particular use case.
* In the beginning, it did slow down our work progress as the team was very unfamiliar with the user interface, but once we began to familiarize ourselves with it, we understood it's use case and how it would be vital for larger teams with more moving parts.
* Technology-wise the team spent a long time initially trying to understand the code that we were trying to build off of, and since the majority of the team didn’t have experiences with the MERN stack, it was quite challenging.
* Debugging Node.js code in some-cases was extremely difficult as it was asynchronous code and hence the code logic was difficult to follow.
* 

Tools/techniques that worked well: 
* Microsoft teams and facebook messenger worked exceptionally well. As for team communications, each member within the team was able to freely discuss the issues they have encountered, and communicate solutions, as well as strategies to complete them.
* Github commit logs were also helpful, as we were able to track each member’s commit history and figure out any potential conflicts that could break our application.
* Scrum worked really well. With this structure, we were able to organize weekly in-person meetings and in duration of the meetings, discuss the features that we desire to implement and allocate them the appropriate priorities and assign them to the members.


If we were to continue working as a team, we would use a different platform for user story assignments and tracking (e.g Microsoft Azure) as it does contain both version control tools and project management systems. 
The process would work similar to what we have had this semester, but with more transparency. We would host weekly in-person sprint meetings to keep everyone engaged and active, and during the meetings conduct appropriate discussions and task assignments. 
The daily standups should provide more insightful details, with also, a project manager/scrum master to keep track of the records, and follow-up privately if any issues were to arise.
After the sprint is finished, in the next sprint meeting, the team would gather again to reflect, and discuss upon improvements that could be made on the project (both management and implementation perspectives)
The procedure described above should be maintained until a good product has been released.
