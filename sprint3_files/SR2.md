Participants: Everyone

Problems: This sprint was front-end heavy. However, we have only 1 group member dedicated towards front-end. Also, a few tasks were blocked by others which slowed down progress. Took some time for the rest of the team to pickup the level of depth of react needed at this point in our project. We also needed to dedicate efforts to understanding the code base.

Good things: Communication was good, standups were useful and productive, as were team meetings. 

Holding us back: Code base cleanup and 'Rona virus.  

Everyone particiaped: yes.
