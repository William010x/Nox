We split up into two User Stories with multiple sub-tasks. Each sub-task is assigned to one member. The First User Story is Nested Sessions List which allows the professor to create courses and create sessions within the courses as a drop down menu. We require a Front-end that will deal with how it will look with the drop down menu. We also have someone in the back end to deal with the api calls to receive the sessions. Another person will work on completeing Download Session Data from previous sprint and another on create a course which deals with creating a course instead of a session (creates a folder).
The second User Story deals with Analytics which allows the professor to see previous data displayed on screen. This is split into the following Sub-Tasks:
Click Session Redirection to Analytics Page, which is exactly in its name; Fetch Data from the Database, which allows us to receive the previous data from that session; Populate Chatbox with Timestamps, dealing with frontend display of chatbox; Sliding and Zoom(Static), deals with sliding of the line graph depending on time and zooming in to a specific moment of the graph.
The goal of the sprint is to deal with the professors' side implementing more features for the prof to use. Team capacity did not increase, we have to do approximately one task/subtask each.

Spikes required to learn front-end and back-end material.
