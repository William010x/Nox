	-Audience interaction in presentations
	-Live polls and quizzes
	-Free trial but is a paid app
	-Strives for similar goals, but represents a more business side while NOX tries to grab student-teacher interaction and communication
-Mentimeter
	-Interactive slides allowing engagement with audience
	-Again, NOX aims more on engaging a student-teacher relationship during lectures
	-NOX allows for quick fixes of presentation and more involvement with comments and questions seen by the professor

-These examples strive to go for a more business/all around usage allowing for more consumers. We find this too broad so with NOX we can strive for a more specific case and aim for more attention to what students and professors want.
