Participants: Everyone

Problems: This sprint was a mixture of both front-end and back-end. However, with the school lockdown was in progress, there were some communication issues within the team, as it was fairly difficult to contact among the team members. Nevertheless, all team members dedicated to their parts and checked the commit logs on github consistently for code changes and finished a good amount of user stories.

Good things: Standups were useful and productive, as were team meetings, all members dedicated to their assigned parts without anyone going to heroic efforts.

Holding us back: Code base cleanup and 'Rona virus, and some communication not in-sync.

Everyone particiaped: yes.
