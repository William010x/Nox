Sprint Reflection: 
    Problems: Starting early, understanding code base, ran into roadblocks.
    Good things: Communication was good, standups were useful and productive, as were team meetings. 
    Holding us back: Lots of other course work, trying to understand and get familiar with the technologies and codebase.
    What we can do to improve: Start earlier, ask for help when we run into a roadblock

Sprint Retrospective:
    Good Practices:     Naming convention of branches and use of git was good.
                        Use of JIRA was correct. 
    Bad Practices:      Need to comment code more or write code that is simple enough that it doesn't need comments. 
                        Need to cleanup code as you work on your userstory/task to keep code clean. 

Everyone particiaped: Yes, everyone had valuable input to contribute.
