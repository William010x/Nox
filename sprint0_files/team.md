Contingency planning:

- if a team member drops out, the team collectively reevaluates if the number of userstories are manageable. If they are manageable, then the rest of the team picks up the slack and pushes forward. If not, then we drop a couple userstories with low priority on the product backlog or simplify them a bit.
- if a team member misses meetings or does not complete agreed upon tasks on time, if they do not have a valid explanation or it is a recurring theme, then we try to get them motivated again, otherwise make a note of it and report it to Ilir.
- if a team member is academically dishonest, we scrap the userstory they're working on, revert any commits we suspect are not original work, and report the matter to Ilir immediately for recourse.
