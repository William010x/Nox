Team Organization

- We organized the team by initially communicationg through facebook messenger. However, we have now switched to managing all team related matters through Microsoft teams. Each team member is organized into a role of front end, back end and full stat based on individual strengths to ensure a ballanced workload. We also voted Ali as a team leader and the role to submit sprint deliverables and software and Shoaib as backup.

Roles and division of work:

- Will - Full stack
- David hu - back end
- Walter - full stack
- Shoaib - full stack
- Ali - full stack
- Saad Afaan Syed - front end
- David - full stack

Submitting sprint deliverables and software:

- Ali (Shoaib backup)

Decision Making

- Decisions were made by a majority vote. If there were objections, we discussed the matter and revoted taking the majority.

Prioritizing user stories

- Our team made decisions about priority and/or points of user stories based on a majority vote from 1 to 5. 1 being highest priority and 5 being lowest priority. If there was a diverse range of votes, we discussed the matter, allowing people with conflicting opinions to provide their reasoning for their vote. We then voted again. We continued this process until the votes were close to a consensus, at which we took the majority vote. On average, we had 2 rounds of voting for each user story.

Meetings

- We would conduct weekly, scrum meetings in person at a UTM building. We would also conduct Microsoft Team meetings throughout the week if needed.

Next Phase

- We will continue making decisions by majority vote.
- Ali will assign user stories based on the role (front end, back end, full stat) assigned to each group member with their consesus and confirmation the assigned task.
- We will break down large user stories into multiple smaller user stories.
- We would continue to add important and useful user stories as well as remove user stories that do not contribute to the goals of the project.
