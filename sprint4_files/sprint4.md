Some of the more difficult subtasks from the previous sprint were moved to this sprint as a new task. Some tasks had a sub-task. Each team member had a task or subtask asssigned to them. 

User Stories: 

Nested Sessions List - allows the professor to create courses and create sessions within the courses as a drop down menu. 2 subtasks - We have a Front-end develloper that will deal with showing the dropdown menu on the screen. We also have someone in the back end to deal with the api calls to receive the sessions. 

average rating as percentage - changes the average rating of the student from a number between 1-3 to something more meaningfull like a percentage. 

sliding live view for the line graph - As time passes throughout a session, the graph will shift hirizontally, showing the latest student activity to the prof during their session. 

Delete button for sessions - Button on each session component would delete the session when clicked on on by the prof. 2 subtasks - front-end portion would create the button and display it on the creen. back-end portion would create an API that deletes the session drom the MongoDB database. 

View analytics for past sessions - Allows the professor to see previous session data displayed on screen. This will allow to Click Session Redirection to Analytics Page, which is exactly in its name; Fetch Data from the Database, which allows us to receive the previous data from that session; Populate Chatbox with Timestamps, dealing with frontend display of chatbox; Sliding and Zoom(Static), deals with sliding of the line graph depending on time and zooming in to a specific moment of the graph. 

The goal of the sprint is to deal with the professors' view, fixing the sessions list and implementing more features for the prof to use. Team capacity increased drastically after realizing that we we could take larger tasks due to other courses comming to an end. Each story has a story point that is ranked in powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 16, ...). We total up to 44 story points.

There were no spikes this sprint.
