Assignment made and can be seen on Jira.
Goal of sprint1 is to be able to familiarize with previous code and include these features which build upon future features. The user stories are chosen because we do not want to overwhelm ourselves with the learning process and building at the same time. We used the poker voting to rate each User Story and determined the assigning by volunteering. Each story has a story point that is ranked in powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 16, ...). We total up to 23 story points.

End of Sprint1 meeting.
