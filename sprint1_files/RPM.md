The next release goal should be to clean up and release dependencies. Some specific things we are looking for is to be able to have more access to the database with display to the client. This can be in the form of numbers and graphs.
We are aiming to direct our attention to those who are shy to ask/answer questions in lectures so things that are out of scope are features that will try to get people to use it. For example, we will not be including any sort of name or identification feature to the public as we want to give the timid students an opportunity to ask anonymously.

Userstories we brainstormed are the following:
-Display students
-Cooldown before a student can send another message
-Profanity filter
-Character minimum and maximum
-Display average as a percent
-Generating unique ID for professors
-Some sort of Poll or Quiz setup for professors
-Feedback Survey
-Analytics (broken down to multiple parts)
-Download session data
-Fix Database Schema
-Including timestamp

As we include the feedback system, we will be able to develop more userstories for more future releases.
