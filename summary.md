Project Objectives:
- Appeal to students that are in-active in lectures
- Engage in-class interaction between professors and students

Principles:
- Only the professor will be granted access to data collected
- Students will not be able to spam messages
- Messages from fellow students in class will not be visible to each other
- Students can vote based on the instruction clarity

Scenario: 
- A student wants to ask a question in lecture, but he is too afraid to raise up his hand due to potential embarassments. In this case NOX comes into play, professors creates a "room" (session) on NOX, students will be given access code to join the "room", then students can ask questions anonymously on NOX while still receive helpful instructions from the professor live.
- A student is confused about the material and wants a re-explanation on the content, with NOX students can vote on a live poll reflecting overall class reaction on whether re-elaboration is needed.

Audiences:
- Professor during lecture: receives live feedbacks from active in-class students
- Students: given a stronger voice for participation in-class
